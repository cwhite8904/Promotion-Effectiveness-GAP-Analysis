# Promotion Effectiveness GAP Analysis

## üìò Project Summary

This Business Analytics project evaluates the impact of promotions on product sales performance using Zara retail data. It combines Python (Google Colab) for data cleaning and analysis, and Power BI for interactive visualization and reporting. The key objective is to identify whether promotional strategies lead to a measurable increase in sales volume.

\- Average_Sales_Promoted  
\- Average_Sales_Non_Promoted  
\- Total_Units_Promoted
